* Tasks
** TODO Add option to choose date
** TODO Add option to choose time fuzzily
The idea is that instead of choosing a time, you get to choose something like 5 min ago, or 3 hours ago.
** TODO Replace "a moment ago" with "just now"
** TODO Wrap timeago calls with our own interface
So we don't have to rely on that particular API.
** TODO Find a replacement for timeago
I don't like that it doesn't handle future times, I'd prefer "just now" and maybe a bit more precision
** TODO Find a way to display precise times, too
** TODO Find a way to show duration between events
an in-between element in the list view?
** TODO Introduce a list of frecent past events to choose from in editNote
Too much typing, says ðŸ¦Ž!
